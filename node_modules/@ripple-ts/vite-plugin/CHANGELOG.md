  Thanks [@copilot-swe-agent](https://github.com/apps/copilot-swe-agent)! - Add
  invalid HTML nesting error detection during SSR in dev mode

  During SSR, if the HTML is malformed (e.g., `<button>` elements nested inside
  other `<button>` elements), the browser tries to repair the HTML, making
  hydration impossible. This change adds runtime validation of HTML nesting during
  SSR to detect these cases and provide clear error messages.
  - Added `push_element` and `pop_element` functions to the server runtime that
    track the element stack during SSR
  - Added comprehensive HTML nesting validation rules based on the HTML spec
  - The server compiler now emits `push_element`/`pop_element` calls when the
    `dev` option is enabled
  - Added `dev` option to `CompileOptions`
  - The Vite plugin now automatically enables dev mode during `vite dev` (serve
    command)
